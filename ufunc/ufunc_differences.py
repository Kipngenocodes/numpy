Differences
A discrete difference means subtracting two successive elements.
E.g. for [1, 2, 3, 4], the discrete difference would be [2-1, 3-2, 4-3] = [1, 1, 1]
To find the discrete difference, use the diff() function.'''
# Example
# Find the discrete difference of the following array:
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([10, 15, 25, 5])
newarr = np.diff(arr)
print(newarr)
